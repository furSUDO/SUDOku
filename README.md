## SUDOku is open source... kinda?

While the main code is fully downloadable and editable, things like commands stay a secret

## Running your own version of SUDOku

Running your own version, or using SUDOku as a base discord bot is as easy as cloning the repository, or downloading it as a zip.

Before we begin, make sure you have node installed on your system, you can check if you do by running ``node -v`` in the command line.

Once you have the main files installed run:
```
npm i
```
This will install all the dependencies that SUDOku needs.

When all the dependencies have installed, run: ```node .``` to run the project. The first time you run ``node .`` you will be asked to edit the newly generated ``config.json`` file. 

In this file you will need to replace the token key with your bot token, which can be found [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
